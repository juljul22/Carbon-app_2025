    <p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>
    <p>
      Trains are among the most climate friendly ways to travel. 
      An electric train emits only <strong>7 g CO₂/pkm </strong> while a diesel train produces around <strong>91 g CO₂/pkm</strong>. 
      </p> <strong>Tip from MR. Eco: Because many passengers share one journey trains are both efficient and comfortable. Every trip by train saves energy and emissions!</strong>
