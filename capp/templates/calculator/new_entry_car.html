    <p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>
    <p>The carbon footprint of your trip depends on your car’s fuel type. 
      A diesel car emits around <strong>229 g CO₂/pkm </strong>, while a petrol car produces about <strong>198g CO₂/pkm </strong>.
      An electric vehicle is the greenest choice with only <strong>59 g CO₂/pkm</strong> which is nearly 75% less than a diesel car.
