    <p>
      The carbon emissions from driving depend on your vehicle's fuel type.
      Diesel cars produce <strong>229 g CO₂/km</strong>, while petrol cars emit
      <strong>198 g CO₂/km</strong>. Electric vehicles are the greenest option,
      producing just <strong>59 g CO₂/km</strong> — roughly one-third the
      emissions of petrol and one-quarter of diesel vehicles.
