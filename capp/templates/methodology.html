    <h1> Our methodology </h1>
    <p>Hey, it's me again, Mr.Eco!</p>
    <br>
    <p>
I'm here to help you measure the carbon emissions produced by the various ways you get around whether you drive a car, 
take a train, fly across the globe, or travel by boat. By analyzing your transportation habits across different modes of 
travel, I'll provide you with personalized insights into how each journey contributes to your overall carbon footprint. 
Armed with this knowledge, you can make informed decisions about greener alternatives, discover which transportation 
methods are most eco-friendly, and track your progress as you work toward reducing your environmental impact. </p>
<br>
<p>
And remember, understanding the environmental impact of your daily commute and travel choices is the first step toward
a more sustainable lifestyle.</p>
<br>
<p>
    Start your journey towards a more sustainable travel today, let's investigate together!

<p><strong>Carbon Emissions Calculation Formula:</strong></p>
<p>Carbon Emissions (kg CO₂) = Distance Traveled (km) × Emission Factor (g CO₂/km) / amout of passengers</p>

</div>
    <div class="transport-grid">
  <div class="transport-card">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-car-side"> Car</i>
    <p>The carbon emissions from driving depend on your vehicle's fuel type. Diesel cars produce
         <strong>229 g CO2/km</strong>, while petrol cars emit <strong>198 g CO2/km</strong>. Electric vehicles are the greenest option, producing just <strong>59 g CO2/km</strong> 
   roughly one-third the emissions of petrol and one-quarter of diesel vehicles.
  </div>

  <div class="transport-card">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-plane"> Airplane</i>
    <p> Economy class produces <strong>127 g CO2/pkm</strong> while business class generates <strong>284 g CO2/pkm</strong>
         Economy is significantly more eco-friendly since emissions are shared among more passengers, 
  whereas business class has fewer passengers per plane, resulting in a higher carbon footprint per person.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="transport-card">
   <i class="fa-solid fa-train-tram"> Train</i>
    <p>Train travel is one of the most eco-friendly transportation options. Electric trains produce just
      <strong>7 g CO2/pkm</strong> while diesel trains emit <strong>91 g CO2/pkm</strong>. Electric trains are significantly
      cleaner and represent the greenest way to travel long distances.
  </div>

  <div class="transport-card">
   <i class="fa-solid fa-ship"> Ferry</i>
    <p>Boat emissions vary significantly based on capacity. Passenger boats produce <strong>186 g CO2/pkm</strong>, making them a moderate option for water travel. 
  Cars transported without passengers emit <strong>377 g CO2/pkm</strong> more than double the emissions of passenger boats.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="transport-card">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-bus"> Bus</i>
    <p>Diesel buses emit <strong>30g of CO₂ per kilometer</strong> consider greener options to keep your travel more 
        sustainable!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="transport-card">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-bicycle"> Bicycle</i>
    <p>This mode of transport produces <strong>no CO₂</strong> during use the perfect choice for 100% sustainable travel.</p>
