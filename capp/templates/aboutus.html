    <p> Julie Joan</p>
    <p>  Hi, I’m Julie, and I’m currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Digital Education for Sustainable Development at Heidelberg University of Education. In my studies, I explore the intersections of education, digitalization, and sustainability. I’m particularly interested in how digital media and innovative approaches can be used to foster a more sustainable future.

    <p> Shaira Krüglstein</p>
    <p>  My name is Shaira, I come from Germany and I study Human Resources Management. I enjoy working with people and learning what motivates them, and that is also why sustainability interests me. I believe that even small actions can make a difference, and I like being part of projects that create awareness and positive change.
