       That’s where Mr. Eco comes in, your friendly carbon detective.
       He helps you uncover the emissions behind your daily travel, turning data into stories and awareness into action.
       With just a few taps, you can see how your choices shape your footprint and how simple changes can make a real difference.
       Because saving the planet shouldn’t feel like homework it should feel like progress.
