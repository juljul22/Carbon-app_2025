      Hi! I'm Mr. Eco, your personal environmental investigator. I'm here to help you uncover the hidden carbon footprint 
      behind every journey you take. Whether you commute by car, catch a bus, board a train, sail across the sea, 
      or fly through the sky, I'll reveal exactly how much CO2 each of your travels produces. Together, we'll investigate 
      your transportation habits, understand the environmental impact of your choices, and discover ways to travel 
      smarter and greener. Ready to become a carbon-conscious explorer? Let's investigate!
